### Example Insight Output

```
üéØ Headline:
"Strong traffic growth of 45% but conversion remains at 2.8% - below SaaS benchmark"

‚úÖ Key Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Unique visitors increased 45% to 1,250 users

2. Select **"Last 7 days"**
3. Wait for data to load
4. Switch between different metrics (Traffic, Funnel, etc.)
5. Notice the üì¶ badge - data loads instantly!
6. Change date range - fetches new data
7. Switch back to 7 days - cached again! ‚ö°
