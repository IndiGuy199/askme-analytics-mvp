### 3. AI Insights API (`web/app/api/ai/insights/route.ts`)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Changes:**

#### POST Handler
1. **Fetch Business Context** (Lines 477-498)
   ```typescript
   const { data: companyData } = await supabase
     .from('companies')
     .select('industry, business_model, primary_goal, audience_region, traffic_sources, monthly_visitors')
     .eq('id', companyId)
     .single();
   ```

2. **Use Context for Benchmarks**
   - Uses company's industry for benchmark selection
   - Falls back to provided industry parameter

3. **Pass Context to AI Generation**
   - Sends business context to `generateInsights()` function

4. **Save Industry with Insights**
   - Stores industry in `ai_insights` table for filtering/analysis

#### generateInsights() Function
1. **Updated Signature** (Lines 276-294)
   - Added optional `businessContext` parameter
   - Type-safe interface for all context fields

2. **Enhanced Prompt** (Lines 298-311)
   - Builds "CLIENT BUSINESS CONTEXT" section when data available
   - Instructs AI to:
     - Tailor insights to specific business type
     - Explain metrics in relevant terms
     - Reference primary goal in actions
     - Consider traffic sources in analysis
     - Use simple, actionable language

**Example Context Section in Prompt:**
```
=== CLIENT BUSINESS CONTEXT ===
Industry: E-commerce
Business Model: B2C
Primary Goal: Sell products
Audience Region: US / Canada
Traffic Sources: Google Search, Facebook / Instagram Ads, Email Marketing
Monthly Visitors: 25,000

Use this context to:
- Tailor insights to this specific business type and industry
- Explain metrics in terms relevant to their business model
- Reference their primary goal when suggesting actions
- Consider their traffic sources when analyzing performance
- Use simple, actionable language for their business context
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### Onboarding Flow
1. User signs up and creates account
2. User fills out company information form
3. **NEW:** User provides business context (industry, goals, traffic, etc.)
4. Form validates all required fields
5. Company record created with full context
6. User proceeds to PostHog setup

### AI Insights Generation Flow
1. User requests AI insights from dashboard
2. API fetches user's company data **including business context**
3. Context is added to OpenAI prompt as "CLIENT BUSINESS CONTEXT"
4. AI generates insights tailored to:
   - Business type (e.g., E-commerce vs SaaS metrics)
   - Primary goal (e.g., "increase add-to-cart rate" for product sales goal)
   - Traffic sources (e.g., "optimize Facebook ads" when FB is main source)
   - Audience region (e.g., consider time zones, local competitors)
5. Insights saved with industry tag for future filtering

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Database Migration
- [x] Migration applied successfully
- [x] All 6 columns added to companies table
- [x] Index created on industry column

### ‚úÖ Onboarding Form
- [ ] Create new test account
- [ ] Verify all 5 new fields appear
- [ ] Test required field validation
- [ ] Verify multi-select works for traffic sources
- [ ] Confirm company creation includes context
- [ ] Check business_model auto-determination

### ‚úÖ AI Insights
- [ ] Generate insights with context-enabled account
- [ ] Verify console logs show "üéØ Business context: {...}"
- [ ] Review generated insights for personalization
- [ ] Compare insights between different industries
- [ ] Verify industry saved in ai_insights table

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Business Context in AI Prompt
**Symptom:** Console shows `üéØ Business context: null`

**Causes:**
1. Company created before migration (no context data)
2. User didn't complete onboarding properly

**Solution:**
- Have user update company settings (if settings page exists)
- Manually update via Supabase SQL Editor:
  ```sql
  UPDATE companies 
  SET industry = 'E-commerce',
      primary_goal = 'Sell products',
      audience_region = 'US / Canada',
      traffic_sources = ARRAY['Google Search', 'Facebook / Instagram Ads'],
      monthly_visitors = 25000
  WHERE id = 'company-id-here';
  ```

### Onboarding Form Validation Errors
**Symptom:** Can't submit form despite filling all fields

**Check:**
- At least one traffic source selected
- Monthly visitors dropdown selected (not empty)
- All dropdowns have valid option selected

### AI Insights Not Using Context
**Symptom:** Generic insights despite having business context

**Check:**
1. Verify context is being fetched (console logs)
2. Verify context is being passed to `generateInsights()`
3. Check OpenAI prompt includes "CLIENT BUSINESS CONTEXT" section
4. Review AI response for industry-specific terms
