## 🎯 Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard
# Go to: SQL Editor → New Query
# Copy/paste: database/migrations/upgrade_ai_insights_v2.sql
# Click "Run"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ ALTER TABLE successful (8 columns added)
✅ Bottleneck column migrated to JSONB
✅ Actions column migrated to structured format
✅ action_tracking table created
✅ Indexes created
✅ RLS policies applied
✅ Views updated
```

**Verification**:
```sql
-- Check new columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'ai_insights' 
AND column_name IN ('summary', 'segments', 'retention_analysis', 'numbers_table', 'meta');

-- Should return 5 rows
```

### Step 2: Activate New UI

```bash
# In VSCode terminal
cd web/app/ai-insights

# Backup old version
mv page.tsx page-old.tsx

# Activate new version
mv page-v2.tsx page.tsx

# Restart dev server (if running)
# Ctrl+C, then: npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Insight Generation

1. **Navigate to AI Insights**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/ai-insights`
   - Select "Last 7 days"
   - Click "Generate New Insights"

2. **First Generation** (Baseline)
   - ✅ Headline appears
   - ✅ Summary paragraph displays
   - ✅ Highlights (3 bullets with ✓)
   - ✅ Segments section (if device/geo data available)
   - ✅ Retention card with benchmark badge
   - ✅ Bottleneck with diagnosis
   - ✅ Actions with impact/effort bars
   - ⚠️ **Numbers table will be empty** (no prior period yet)
   - ⚠️ **Meta shows**: `period_compared: "insufficient_prior"`

3. **Second Generation** (With Comparison)
   - Wait 1 minute
   - Click "Generate New Insights" again
   - ✅ **Now you should see**:
     - Numbers table populated with Current vs Prior
     - Delta indicators (↗️ +X% or ↘️ -X%)
     - Headline includes % change (e.g., "up 18% WoW")
     - "vs Prior Period" badge in header
     - Meta shows: `period_compared: "prior_provided"`

4. **Test Action Sorting**
   - Click dropdown: "Impact (High → Low)"
   - Try: "Effort (Low → High)" - Quick wins first
   - Try: "Best Score" - Optimal ROI

5. **Test Collapsible Sections**
   - Click any section header to collapse
   - Click again to expand

### Step 4: Verify Benchmark System

**Check Retention Badge**:
- If D7 retention is 24%:
  - Badge should show: **Exceeds Target** (green with 🏆)
  - Note should mention: "above 20-25% benchmark"

- If D7 retention is 15%:
  - Badge should show: **Below Target** (red with ↘️)
  - Note should suggest improvement actions

**Check Segment Analysis**:
- If mobile traffic > 60%:
  - Should see blue card: "Mobile users dominate at 65%"
  - Action hint: "Optimize mobile sign-up flow"

- If one country dominates:
  - Should see green card: "US represents 52% of traffic"
  - Action hint: "Consider US-specific campaigns"

## 📊 What You'll See (Example)

### Headline
> "Traffic up 18% WoW but conversion stuck at 1.85% - well below 3-5% SaaS benchmark"

### Summary
> Your unique visitors increased to 1,250 users with strong engagement (2.76 pages/user). However, conversion remains significantly below industry standards. Mobile dominates at 53% but may be suffering on smaller screens. The good news: D7 retention at 24% exceeds targets, showing product-market fit.

### Numbers Table
| Metric | Current | Prior | Change |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Unique Users | 1,250 | 1,050 | ↗️ +19.0% |
| Conversion Rate | 1.85% | 1.80% | ↗️ +2.8% |
| D7 Retention | 24.0% | 22.5% | ↗️ +6.7% |
| Avg Session Time | 3m 45s | 3m 20s | ↗️ +12.5% |

### Segments
**📱 Mobile Users**
- Insight: "Mobile traffic represents 53% of visitors but shows 15% lower conversion than desktop"
- Action: "Optimize mobile sign-up flow and reduce form fields"

**🌍 US Region**
- Insight: "United States accounts for 52% of traffic with above-average engagement"
- Action: "Double down on US-specific marketing channels"

### Retention Analysis
- **D7 Retention**: 24.0%
- **Status**: ✅ **Exceeds Target** (20-25% benchmark)
- **Note**: "Retention exceeds industry standard, indicating strong product-market fit and user satisfaction"

### Main Bottleneck
**Email Verified** → **Trial Started** (12.5% drop)

**Diagnosis**: "40 users lost at email verification step, suggesting friction in email confirmation process"

**Possible Root Causes**:
1. Email verification links may be delayed or landing in spam folders
2. Verification process adds extra friction to onboarding flow
3. Users may be abandoning during the wait time for email delivery

### Recommended Actions (Sorted by Impact)

**1. 🔽 Funnel: Implement one-click email verification**
- **Why**: Reduce 12.5% drop-off at email verification step, currently losing 40 potential users
- **Impact**: ■■■■■ (5/5)
- **Effort**: ■■□□□ (2/5)
- **Confidence**: 85%
- **Expected Lift**: +10.5%

**2. 📱 Mobile: Optimize mobile sign-up experience**
- **Why**: 53% of traffic is mobile but conversion lags behind desktop by 15%
- **Impact**: ■■■■□ (4/5)
- **Effort**: ■■■□□ (3/5)
- **Confidence**: 75%
- **Expected Lift**: +8.3%

**3. 🔽 Funnel: A/B test removing email verification for trials**
- **Why**: Immediate access could improve 1.85% conversion rate toward 3-5% benchmark
- **Impact**: ■■■■□ (4/5)
- **Effort**: ■■□□□ (2/5)
- **Confidence**: 70%
- **Expected Lift**: +12.0%

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails with "column already exists"

**Solution**: Someone already ran part of the migration. Run this to check:
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'ai_insights' 
ORDER BY column_name;
```

If new columns exist, skip to Step 2.

### Issue: "No analytics data available"

**Cause**: KPIs not fetched from PostHog

**Solution**:
1. Check PostHog API key in `.env.local`
2. Verify company has `posthog_client_id` set
3. Try navigating to Analytics page first to trigger data fetch

### Issue: Fallback insights appear (generic text)

**Cause**: OpenAI returned invalid JSON

**Solution**:
- Normal behavior (happens <1% of time)
- Click "Generate New Insights" again
- If persistent:
  - Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
  - Verify OpenAI API quota not exceeded
  - Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Numbers table shows "insufficient_prior"

**Expected**: First generation has no prior period

**Solution**: Generate insights again after 1 minute. Second generation will:
1. Fetch first generation's KPIs from `analytics_snapshots`
2. Use as prior period for comparison
3. Display numbers table with deltas

### Issue: Segments section empty

**Normal**: Segments only appear when AI identifies clear patterns

**Reasons why segments might not appear**:
- Traffic too low (<100 users)
- Even distribution across devices/geos
- AI couldn't find actionable segment insight

Not a bug - just means no significant segment story.
