# Fixes Applied - October 24, 2025

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Demo Page Duplicate Function Error
**Problem:** `DashboardDemo` function was declared twice, causing compilation error:
```
Module parse failed: Identifier 'DashboardDemo' has already been declared
```

**Solution:** Removed the duplicate `DashboardDemo` function (lines 443-500) from `/app/demo/page.tsx`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Page now compiles without errors

---

### 2. Email Service Configuration
**Problem:** Contact form needed email service, but Gmail app passwords aren't available for your account type.

**Solution:** Switched from nodemailer (SMTP) to Resend API in `/app/api/contact/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced nodemailer code with Resend implementation
- ‚úÖ Resend package already installed (v4.8.0)
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation in `CONTACT_EMAIL_SETUP.md`
- ‚úÖ Backup nodemailer version saved in `route-resend.ts` (if needed later)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Ready - Just needs environment variable setup
